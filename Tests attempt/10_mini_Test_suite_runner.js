/*Mini Test Suite Runner
Build a mini test suite runner that executes test cases and generates a summary report. This question combines ALL topics: var/let/const, if-else, switch, for loop, while loop, do...while, operators (===, !==, &&, ||, ??, ternary), typeof checks, and identifiers.

Each test case has a name, expected value, actual value, and comparison type (strictEqual, looseEqual, typeCheck, truthy, lessThan). Run all tests, track pass/fail/error counts, find consecutive passes from start (while loop), find first failure (do...while), and print a comprehensive report.
Input Format
An array of test case objects with name, actual, expected, and type properties

Output Format
Individual test results, then a comprehensive summary report with metrics

Input
{ name: "Status code is 200", actual: 200, expected: 200, type: "strictEqual" }
Output
✅ TC-01: Status code is 200 → PASS (200 === 200) ... Pass Rate: 80.00% Overall: ❌ FAILED

Interview Hints
Use switch to handle different comparison types (strictEqual, looseEqual, typeCheck, truthy, lessThan)
Use a while loop to count consecutive passes from the start
Use a do...while loop to find the first failure in results
